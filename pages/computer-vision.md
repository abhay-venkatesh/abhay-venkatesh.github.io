# On Computer Vision

What is nature of computer vision? What is its purpose? Computer vision is the
practice of transforming a $$(W\times H\times 3)$$-dimensional array into
meaning. Such an array is meaningful insofar either a human can directly
understand it, or the array contains that which is necessary to an end that is
purposeful for humanity.

## Intelligence Augmentation

Trying to replace the full cognitive functionality of a human is a politically
dangerous problem: you might run into serious trouble if you succeed. We need
not worry what happens to the jobs, rather, we might even get wiped out of existence.

Furthermore, the promise of modeling the human intelligence has been an enigma since the dawn
of human civilization itself, and since the dawn of human civilization, we have
naively thought that we are "almost there". 

### The Key Question

For that reason, we completely abandon our search for true human-level cognitive
modeling in favor of human intelligence augmentation. Therefore, the key 
question that we will be tackling with is: what is something humans really suck at,
but computers can do really well? Specializing our key question for computer vision 
leads us to: __what visual cognitive functions do humans struggle with, but
computers excel at?__

Engineering effort expended in this direction will be at least ten times more
valuable; artificial general intelligence before it is can meet human level 
intelligence is more or less worthless.

### Key Tasks

What might be such tasks? 

## Machine Learning

We begin by trying to run before we can walk. The reason for this is that we 
have figured out dumb (_artificially_ intelligent) ways to perform the
fundamental task in computer vision (if there is one): the task of object
recognition.
