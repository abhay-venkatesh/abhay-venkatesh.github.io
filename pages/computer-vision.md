# On Computer Vision

What is nature of computer vision? What is its purpose? Computer vision is the
practice of transforming a $$(W\times H\times 3)$$-dimensional array into
meaning. Such an array is meaningful insofar either a human can directly
understand it, or the array contains that which is necessary to an end that is
purposeful for humanity.

## Intelligence Augmentation

Trying to replace the full cognitive functionality of a human is a politically
dangerous problem: you might run into serious trouble if you succeed. We need
not worry what happens to jobs and the economy, rather, we risk getting wiped out of existence.

Furthermore, the promise of modeling the human intelligence has been an enigma since the dawn
of human civilization itself, and since the dawn of human civilization, we have
naively thought that we are "almost there". 

## The Key Question

For that reason, we abandon our search for true human-level cognitive
modeling in favor of human _intelligence augmentation_. Therefore, the key 
question that we will be tackling with is: what is something humans really suck at,
but computers can do really well? Specializing our key question for computer vision 
leads us to: __what visual cognitive functions do humans struggle with, but
computers excel at?__

Engineering effort expended in this direction will be an order of magnitude more
valuable relative to human cognitive modeling; artificial general intelligence 
before it can match human-level intelligence is more or less worthless.

## Key Tasks

While researchers can perhaps scratch the surface of such tasks,
the gap between theory and practice is much larger than most people think it is.
It is nearly impossible for the ivory tower academic to know what problems
are actually worth solving.

What are the tasks that we can solve? What are the important tasks? What 
is the intersection?

### Big Data

What might be such tasks? A two-year-old can count all the animals in an image.
But what if this is an exceedingly large image? Or rather, what if we have
billions of images? It would be unpleasant, to say the least, to make a child
take on this task. Hence, any repetitive, brute-force work at scale, is something
best left for a machine. Processing billions of images in a stochastic manner
can be a key task. Unfortunately, this paradigm is overexplored, and overexploited,
sometimes by [tyrannical governments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html).

### Defense

Defense is the last worthwhile computer vision area. Self-driving cars is 
overly competitive, and it is unclear if it is ever arriving. Big platforms
are also over-exploited: there will be no more big consumer tech companies.
Other marginal use cases also seem over-exploited, such as safety, retail,
manufacturing inspection, OCR, and medical imaging. What is taboo today in the
West? Defense. One is not allowed to publicly defend one's country in the 
West. Hence, _computer vision applications for defense is the only area
one must focus on_.

## Machine Learning

We begin by trying to run before we can walk. The reason for this is that we 
have figured out dumb (_artificially_ intelligent) ways to perform the
fundamental task in computer vision (if there is one): the task of object
recognition.
