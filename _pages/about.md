He has worked closely with funds like [**Greylock**](https://greylock.com/), [**Index**](https://www.indexventures.com/) and others.

Previously, he joined Anduril as one of the first AI hires under [**Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bschimpf/) (who was previously Director of Engineering at **[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)**, training under [**Palantir CEO Alex Karp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Karp)), with whom he [invented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230089776A1/en) [Lattice for Mission Autonomy](https://www.anduril.com/mission-autonomy/). 

He saw Anduril from _<50 employees to more than 5000_, from _$250M valuation to **$28B**_ in valuation and growing. He wrote down his learnings from Anduril and startups [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFR3scxuGSY848qA7JDYEHI2uVB7f5nzIj_jIH7ihZQ/edit). 

Before Anduril, Abhay was an AI researcher publishing papers in conferences like **AAAI**, **CVPR** and similar, and dropped out of a PhD in AI from **[Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/)**. He trained in AI at institutions such as [**Meta**](https://about.meta.com/) and [**Stanford**](https://www.stanford.edu/).
