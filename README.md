## Interests
I am broadly interested in restarting the project of technological innovation that ended in the late 1960s. 

Things that are radically underrated (and hence interest me):
* Engineering
* Systems design
* Political philosophy
* The truth about culture and society
* The question of the unidentifiable human "X"
* The Decentralized Internet
* The New Defense
* Free-market healthcare
* The Longevity Project
* Nuclear Energy
* Space Exploration
