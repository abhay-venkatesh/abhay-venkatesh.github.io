## Interests
I am broadly interested in restarting the project of technological innovation that ended in the late 1960s. 

Things that are radically underrated (and hence interest me):
* Engineering
* Systems design
* Political philosophy and government reform
* The truth about culture, society, and the unidentifiable human "X"
* The Decentralized Internet
* The New Defense
* Free-market healthcare and advanced biotechnology
* The Longevity Project
* Nuclear Energy
* Space Exploration
* Macro opportunities in the age of bubbles
* Food engineering
* Robotics
* Human-computer symbiosis
* Skin-in-the-game for industries without skin-in-the-game (e.g. higher ed., unelected government agencies)
