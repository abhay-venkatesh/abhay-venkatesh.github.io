# The Anti-Search Engine
Search engines produce answers based on consensus, i.e. what is the most likely truth given all the data? However, the most important questions have answers that are not based on consensus. Every undiscovered truth is predicated on such questions, but you can't plug these questions into a search engine. Hence, I define the "Anti-Search Engine" as a link repository that might lead one to questions that do not have consensus-based answers.
