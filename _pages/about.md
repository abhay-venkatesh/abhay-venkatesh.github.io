Abhay is building [Frontier AI](https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-partners-with-openai-to-advance-u-s-artificial-intelligence-leadership-and-protect-u-s/) at [**Anduril**](http://anduril.com/) and investing in startups, many of which have raised follow-on financing from funds like **[Founders Fund](https://foundersfund.com/)**, **[Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/)** and **[Benchmark](https://benchmark.com/)**, and achieved unicorn status.

Previously, he joined Anduril as one of the first AI hires under **CEO** [Brian Schimpf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bschimpf/), with whom he [invented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230089776A1/en) [Lattice for Mission Autonomy](https://www.anduril.com/mission-autonomy/). 

He saw Anduril from _<50 employees to more than 5000_, from _$250M valuation to **$28B**_ in valuation and growing. He wrote down his learnings from Anduril and startups [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFR3scxuGSY848qA7JDYEHI2uVB7f5nzIj_jIH7ihZQ/edit). 

Before Anduril, he was an AI researcher publishing papers in conferences like **AAAI**, **CVPR** and similar, and dropped out of a PhD in AI from **Carnegie Mellon**.
