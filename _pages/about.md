Abhay is building [Frontier AI](https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-partners-with-openai-to-advance-u-s-artificial-intelligence-leadership-and-protect-u-s/) at [Anduril](http://anduril.com/) and investing in startups, many of which have raised follow-on financing from funds like Founders Fund, Sequoia and Benchmark, and achieved unicorn status.

Previously, he joined Anduril as one of the first AI hires under CEO [Brian Schimpf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bschimpf/), with whom he [invented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230089776A1/en) [Lattice for Mission Autonomy](https://www.anduril.com/mission-autonomy/). 

He saw Anduril from <50 employees to more than 5000, from $250M valuation to $28B in valuation and growing. 

Before that, he was an AI researcher publishing papers in conferences like AAAI, CVPR and similar, and dropped out of a PhD in AI from Carnegie Mellon.

He wrote down his learnings from Anduril and startups [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFR3scxuGSY848qA7JDYEHI2uVB7f5nzIj_jIH7ihZQ/edit).
