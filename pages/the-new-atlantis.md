# The New Atlantis

Science has [come to an end](https://www.edge.org/conversation/john_horgan-why-i-think-science-is-ending). 
No, please do not remind me of narrow success (if it can be called success at all) in areas such as CRISPR, AI, Quantum Computing or Superstring Theory. Specific success reminds us of a general failure; our world in 2019 is radically different from the years of the early 20th, or 19th centuries where every generation made fundamental discoveries ceaselessly. 

While I do not yet have the resources to save science, I attempt to stimulate whatever meager interest in it
I can by sharing some interesting links here.
