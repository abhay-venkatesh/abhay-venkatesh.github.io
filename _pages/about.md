Abhay is building Frontier AI at [Anduril](http://anduril.com/) and [investing in startups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sEgQPZT6IGMXAwd67eccIpC0DQq7rMoy5_nj43-9p6E/edit?usp=sharing) that have raised follow-on financing from funds like **Founders Fund**, **Sequoia** and **Benchmark**.

Previously, he joined Anduril as one of the first AI hires under CEO [Brian Schimpf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bschimpf/), with whom he [invented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230089776A1/en) [Lattice for Mission Autonomy](https://www.anduril.com/mission-autonomy/). 

He saw Anduril from <50 employees to more than 5000, from $250M valuation to $28B in valuation and growing. 

He wrote down his learnings from Anduril and startups more generally [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFR3scxuGSY848qA7JDYEHI2uVB7f5nzIj_jIH7ihZQ/edit).
